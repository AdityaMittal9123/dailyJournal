This is an exercise in Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. It's a simple blogging web application where one can add new blog posts, view them in their own dedicated route, and delete them. The posts are stored in a local MongoDB database. EJS templating is used for the HTML pages, Bootstrap is also used, along with some custom CSS styling.
